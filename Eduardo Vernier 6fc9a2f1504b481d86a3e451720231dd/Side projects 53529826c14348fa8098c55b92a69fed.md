## bike de boa

*bike de boa* is an open and collaborative map of places to park your bike. It lets people search for bike parking spots around the city and shows reviews and information curated by other local cyclists.

We've cataloged 3 thousand pieces of bike infrastructure in 50 Brazilian cities, accumulating over a thousand reviews. We've built this app hoping that it helps cyclists get around safely in a country where bikes are not a popular means of transport and are seen mostly as obstacles on the road.

I worked mainly on the android app which was discontinued after the whole application was reimplemented as a Progressive Web App. The website has currently over 200k visits!

## training notification channels

In my student tennis club, if a member can't make it to their regularly scheduled tennis practice on a given day, his/her spot becomes available for anyone in the club to fill in for free. The problem was that these spots are advertised in a website that people hardly checked.  

So I created a set of channels and bots on Telegram that notify club members of freed positions. 

After the system was implemented - using Python code running on EC2 - it was adopted by over 200 club members and we saw significant increase in the number of people taking part in training.

## fitness tracker

I've been using my calendar and strava for tracking my sports activity. I do this to organize myself and keep motivated. Recently I wrote a program that reads these two feeds and creates a plot like this one. This script runs daily and sets this image as my wallpaper. Click on the image to make it bigger.
